                I am a curious frontend developer with two years of experience
                in technology and user interface design. With a solid grasp of
                frontend fundamentals, I am currently learning the popular React
                library. Programming is a fascinating world that I become more
                passionate about every day, and I am always ready to apply my
                skills through continuous learning and experience.

                During this time, I have worked on numerous small and
                medium-sized projects using React and TypeScript, gaining
                valuable experience. I have always focused on creating
                responsive and user-friendly interfaces across various devices
                and browsers. Currently, I am learning Next.js to master new
                techniques and tools that will help me tackle more complex web
                development projects.

                With skills in responsive design, Atomic Design, and close
                collaboration with teams, I am eager to apply my expertise to
                new projects. For me, programming is not just a job, but an
                endless world of learning and creativity that I grow more
                passionate about every day.
